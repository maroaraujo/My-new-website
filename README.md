# Test to enter on the School of Code

Before entering in SoC I didn't know anything about coding, and we needed to create a website from scrath to show that we could learn by ourselves. For me was a BIG thing when I deployed my first website, it is really simple but it was just the first steps, so I'm happy to keep it to remember how much I've learned.

deployed website:

## Your Tribute Page TASK

You will now be using git and vscode to:

  * _clone_ your repository to your local machine (use the HTTPS link)

  * _update_ the sample HTML and CSS files with your own code (from CodePen) 

  * _add, commit and push_ your changes to your brand new repository. Pretty cool eh?

  All of these steps have been covered in step 6 of your *learning journey* if you need any clues as to what to do maybe think about looking back at these resources ðŸ¤·
